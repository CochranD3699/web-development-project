            <h2>A little about me</h2>
            <p>
                I joined the US Marine Corps shortly after graduating from Sprayberry. 
                Like many in my age group, I didn't really know what I wanted to be when I 
                grew up. Honestly, I think my hope was that I would never have to grow up 
                (or at the very least, not old).
                <br><br>
                Many, many, many years, a few wrong turns, and maybe a couple of detours later; 
                I realized what was very obvious from my early 20's, I loved working on computers. 
                I love trying to figure out how to get it to do what I want it to. Granted this 
                can sometimes drive me a little crazy when I am right in the middle of a problem. 
                However, the joy and satisfaction of having solved the riddle of the day is 
                incomparable. 
                <br><br>
                I am greatful for more than a few of my detours as that has led me to who I am 
                today. I do not have a prestigous resume, but I do have an awesome family. 
                My husband and I have a wonderful blended family that includes 3 adult children, 
                2 grandchildren, and 2 cute dogs.                
                <br><br>
                Lastly, I will mention that my husband is a retired Army Officer and I am very 
                much a 1 tour enlisted Marine, but that just goes to show you.
